+ VS 2010 Taskbar Build Progress Add-In +
+---------------------------------------+

1. CHANGELOG
------------

v0.3
----

Bug fix: Build progress would often not display, due to the BuildEvents object
being garbage-collected after the event handlers had been assigned.  

v0.21
-----

Bug fix: Failed build icon overlay is not replaced with the successful build 
icon overlay when a successful build follows a failed build.

v0.2
----

Overlay icons added.  A tick is displayed if the build was successful, a cross
if there was a failure.

v0.1
----

Initial version.  Build progress is displayed in the Windows 7 task bar icon.  
If one or more of the projects contains an error, the progress bar will turn 
red.


2. INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
----------------------------

Download the latest version of the build progress zip file from 
http://www.github.com/alastairs/buildprogress/downloads.  In the zip file is a
folder called BuildProgress.  Simply copy the contents of this folder to 
My Documents\Visual Studio 2010\AddIns.  You may need to create the AddIns 
directory if it does not already exist at the specified location.  

In many cases, you will need to "unblock" the binary files on Windows Vista and 
Windows 7 by right-clicking the file and choosing Properties, then clicking the 
Unblock button at the bottom of the General tab.  Screenshots and an explanation
of why this is required are available from 
http://www.hanselman.com/blog/FavIconsInternetZonesAndProjectsFromATrustworthySource.aspx


2.1 Installation to a UNC Share
-------------------------------

If your My Documents folder is mapped to a network share (e.g., in some 
corporate environments), you will need to complete a one-time extra step to 
relax the security restrictions on the AddIns directory.  Run the Visual Studio
2010 Command Prompt as an Administrator and enter the following command, 
substituting servername, sharename and username for appropriate values for your
environment.  Note that username may need to be a folder hierarchy fragment, and
not just a username.

 > caspol -m -ag LocalIntranet_Zone -url 
   "\\servername\sharename\username\Visual Studio 2010\Addins\*" FullTrust -n 
   "Visual Studio 2010 Add-ins" -d "Visual Studio 2010 Add-ins"



3. BUILD INSTRUCTIONS
---------------------

If you would prefer to build the add-in yourself, you'll need to follow these
steps.

  1. Check out the source from GitHub, or use the download link on the 
     repository page.
  2. Download the Windows API Codepack from 
     http://code.msdn.microsoft.com/WindowsAPICodePack and build the solution.
     Copy the Microsoft.WindowsAPICodePack.dll and the 
     Microsoft.WindowsAPICodePack.Shell.dll into the libs\WindowsAPICodePack 
     directory in the BuildProgress solution directory.  
  3. Build the BuildProgress solution.  Drop the following files into
     My Documents\Visual Studio 2010\AddIns:
	   * BuildProgress.AddIn
	   * BuildProgress.dll
	   * Microsoft.WindowsAPICodePack.dll
	   * Microsoft.WindowsAPICodePack.Shell.dll     
  4. If you want to debug the Add-In, you will need to complete the following
     steps.
       a. In "BuildProgress - For Testing.AddIn", update the Extensibility/
          Addin/Assembly element to point to built binary in your build progress
          add-in development environment
       b. Place the "BuildProgress - For Testing.AddIn" file in 
	      My Documents\Visual Studio 2010\AddIns
	   c. Restart Visual Studio 2010.
