+ VS 2010 Taskbar Build Progress Add-In +
+---------------------------------------+

1. CHANGELOG
------------

v0.21
-----

Bug fix: Failed build icon overlay is not replaced with the successful build 
icon overlay when a successful build follows a failed build.

v0.2
----

Overlay icons added.  A tick is displayed if the build was successful, a cross
if there was a failure.

v0.1
----

Initial version.  Build progress is displayed in the Windows 7 task bar icon.  
If one or more of the projects contains an error, the progress bar will turn 
red.


2. BUILD INSTRUCTIONS
---------------------

  1. Check out the source from GitHub, or use the download link on the 
     repository page.
  2. Download the Windows API Codepack from 
     http://code.msdn.microsoft.com/WindowsAPICodePack and build the solution.
     Copy the Microsoft.WindowsAPICodePack.dll and the 
     Microsoft.WindowsAPICodePack.Shell.dll into the libs\WindowsAPICodePack 
     directory in the BuildProgress solution directory.  
  3. Build the BuildProgress solution.  Drop the following files into
     My Documents\Visual Studio 2010\AddIns:
	   * BuildProgress.AddIn
	   * BuildProgress.dll
	   * Microsoft.WindowsAPICodePack.dll
	   * Microsoft.WindowsAPICodePack.Shell.dll     
  4. If you want to debug the Add-In, you will need to complete the following
     steps.
       a. In "BuildProgress - For Testing.AddIn", update the Extensibility/
          Addin/Assembly element to point to built binary in your build progress
          add-in development environment
       b. Place the "BuildProgress - For Testing.AddIn" file in 
	      My Documents\Visual Studio 2010\AddIns
	   c. Restart Visual Studio 2010.
